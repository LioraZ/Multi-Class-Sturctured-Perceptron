Run ex2.py for model 1 & 2, and run structured_perceptron.py for model 3:

For both scripts, you will first need to run the script with the train command line parameter to create a file model_a/model_b/model_c, and only then run the scripts with the test command line parameter.

To run ex2.py:
python3 ex2.py a/b train test (where 'a' or 'b' represent the model type, and you can either run with just train or just test, but running with test is only allowed once the model file was created for the specific type)

To run structured_perceptron.py:
python3 structured perceptron.py train test (where you can either run with just train or just test, but running with test is only allowed once the model file was created)
